# Getting Started with Rust

Welcome to your first lesson in the Rustacean faith!

## Installation

First, you must install the sacred compiler:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Your First Program

Behold, the traditional greeting:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Core Principles

The Rust faith is built upon three pillars:

1. **Memory Safety** - No null pointer dereferences
2. **Fearless Concurrency** - Data races are prevented at compile time
3. **Zero-Cost Abstractions** - What you don't use, you don't pay for
