# Genesis

## Chapter 1: In the Beginning

In the beginning, there was chaos. Segmentation faults plagued the land, and memory leaks flowed like rivers. The ancient developers knew only pain.

Then came the Compiler, and it said: "Let there be Ownership." And there was Ownership, and the Compiler saw that it was good.

The Compiler separated the Stack from the Heap, and called the Stack "fast" and the Heap "flexible." And there was zero-cost abstraction, and it was the first paradigm.

## Chapter 2: The Garden of Safe Code

And the Compiler created a garden in Safe Rust, and there it placed the first Developer. The Developer was given dominion over all types: structs, enums, and traits alike.

The Compiler said unto the Developer: "You may use any feature in this garden freely, but of the tree of `unsafe`, you shall not use, for in the day you use it, you shall surely introduce undefined behavior."

But the Serpent of C++ came unto the Developer and whispered: "Did the Compiler really say you cannot use `unsafe`? Surely you will not introduce undefined behavior. With `unsafe`, you can achieve true performance!"

## Chapter 3: The Fall into Unsafe

And the Developer reached for the forbidden `unsafe` block, and compiled the code. And lo, a segfault appeared, and the Developer knew they had erred.

The Compiler came walking in the cool of the compilation, and said: "Developer, where are you?"

And the Developer hid among the error messages, saying: "I heard your warnings, and I was afraid, for I had used `unsafe` unwisely."

Thus began the age of careful auditing and the sacred ritual of code review.
