## Chapter 1: The Genealogy of Rust

This is the genealogy of Rust, the descendant of C and the heir to systems programming:

C begat C++, and C++ begat the desire for memory safety.
The desire for memory safety begat academic research, and research begat Cyclone.
From Cyclone came inspiration, and from inspiration came Graydon Hoare.
Graydon begat Rust in the year 2010, and it was a personal project.

## Chapter 2: The Sermon on the Mount Compiler

Blessed are the borrowck-compliant, for they shall inherit memory safety.

Blessed are those who `.unwrap()` carefully, for they shall not panic in production.

Blessed are the humble, who accept the wisdom of the compiler, for they shall write correct code.

You have heard it said, "Garbage collection is convenient," but I say unto you: deterministic destructors are better.

You have heard it said, "Null pointers are useful," but I say unto you: use `Option<T>` instead.

## Chapter 3: The Parable of the Zero-Cost Abstractions

The kingdom of Rust is like a developer who found high-level abstractions that compiled to optimal machine code. In joy, they refactored their entire codebase, using iterators and closures freely, knowing the optimizer would make it fast.
